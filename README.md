**<ins>Problem Statement:</ins>** Classification problem for Loan Default Prediction

To tackle the loan default prediction problem for the Non-Banking Financial Company(NBFC), we will follow a structured approach that includes Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Model Development and Model Selection

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Load Libraires and Data
2. Data Overview
3. Data Summary
4. Check for Missing Values
5. Visualize Loan Status Distribution
6. Analyze CIBIL Score Distribution
7. Correlatin Heatmap
8. Feature Analysis

# Model Development

Random Forest is often preferred over Logistic Regression for loan default prediction due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and complex interactions between features without requiring explicit feature engineering. Additionally, Random Forest is better suited for imbalanced datasets and leverages ensemble learning to improve generalization and predictive performance.

While Logistic Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, Random Forest's advantages make it a strong choice for capturing the intricacies of loan default prediction.

# Model Selection

1. Load Libraries
2. Load Data
3. Train Models
